Based on the advancing fronts algorithm outlined in Valera *et al.*, [Computational Particle Mechanics 2, 161 (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40571-015-0045-8).

> Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia.
> A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place.
> The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader.
> Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum".

# Usage

Complete documentation can be found at [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/spherical-cow/).

A simple example to get you packing spheres of radii (0.1..0.2) into a container sphere of radius 2.
```rust
extern crate nalgebra;
extern crate rand;
extern crate spherical_cow;

use spherical_cow::shapes::Sphere;
use rand::distributions::Uniform;
use nalgebra::Point3;

fn main() {
    let boundary = Sphere::new(Point3::origin(), 2.0).unwrap();
    let mut sizes = Uniform::new(0.1, 0.2);

    let spheres = spherical_cow::pack_spheres(boundary, &mut sizes).unwrap();

    println!("Number of spheres: {}", spheres.len());
}
```

More elaborate examples can be found in the [examples](examples/) directory.

# Output

True to its name, it is indeed possible to build a spherical cow:

![spherical cow in vacuum](https://github.com/Libbum/spherical-cow/blob/master/examples/objects/cow_output.jpg?raw=true)

You can run this example yourself from [show_in_cow](examples/show_in_cow.rs).

# Example use cases

The paper which this algorithm comes from gives two examples of real world use cases:

1. Sphere packing a skull model to study fractures due to shocks and penetrating objects.
2. Sphere packing a cutting tool to identify the failure / breaking points when the tool is placed under load.

The reason this library was initially written was to optimise the layout of inflatable [space habitats](https://github.com/Libbum/space-habitats) which may one day be constructed on the Moon and Mars.
